Determines whether two strings share any common characters by converting each string into a set of unique characters and checking for intersection between these sets. The solution processes multiple query pairs, for each pair it creates HashSet collections from both strings to eliminate duplicate characters, then uses the Overlaps method to efficiently check if there is any character present in both sets. If at least one common character exists between the two sets, it returns "YES" indicating the strings share common characters; otherwise it returns "NO".
