Demonstrates the complete insertion sort algorithm by sorting an array incrementally and displaying the array state after each iteration. Starting from the second element, the algorithm treats the left portion as sorted and progressively inserts each subsequent element into its correct position within this sorted section. For each element, it shifts larger values to the right until finding the proper insertion point, then places the current element. After processing each element, the current state of the array is printed, visually showing how the sorted portion grows with each step until the entire array is ordered.
