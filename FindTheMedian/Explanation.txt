Calculates the median of an array by first sorting all elements in ascending order and then selecting the middle element. The solution assumes the input array has an odd number of elements, which guarantees a single middle value. After sorting, the median is directly accessed at the central index position, which is exactly half the array length due to zero-based indexing. This efficient approach leverages the built-in sorting functionality and provides the median value with minimal computational overhead, making it optimal for finding the central tendency of the dataset.
