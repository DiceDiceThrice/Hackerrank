Implements a dynamic array system that processes two types of queries on a collection of sequences. The solution initializes n empty lists and maintains a lastAnswer variable that starts at 0. For each query, it calculates an index using the formula (x XOR lastAnswer) % n. Query type 1 appends the integer y to the sequence at the calculated index. Query type 2 assigns the value at position y % size in the sequence to lastAnswer and records this value in the answers list. The algorithm efficiently handles up to 100,000 queries by using list operations and bitwise XOR for index calculation, ensuring optimal performance while maintaining the dynamic nature of the data structure
