The provided C# code compares two arrays, a and b, each with three integers, representing scores for Alice and Bob. For each position, if Alice's value (a[i]) is greater than Bob's (b[i]), Alice receives a point. If Bob's is greater, Bob gets a point. The scores are returned as a two-element array. The program reads input, calls the comparison function, and prints the final scores.
