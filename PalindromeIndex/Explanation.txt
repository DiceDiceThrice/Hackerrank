Finds the index of a character that can be removed to make a string a palindrome. It uses a two-pointer approach that starts from both ends of the string and moves toward the center. When it encounters a mismatch between characters at the left and right positions, it checks two possibilities: whether removing the left character creates a palindrome by verifying the substring from left+1 to right, or whether removing the right character creates a palindrome by checking the substring from left to right-1. If either check succeeds, it returns the corresponding index; if both fail, it returns -1 indicating no single removal can make the string palindromic. If the entire string is already a palindrome, it also returns -1.
