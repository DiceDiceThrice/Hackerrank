Implements the partitioning step of the quicksort algorithm using the first element as the pivot. The solution divides the input array into three segments: elements smaller than the pivot are collected in a left list, elements greater than or equal to the pivot go into a right list, and the pivot itself remains separate. Finally, these three components are combined into a new list with the left elements first, followed by the pivot, and then the right elements. This single partitioning operation rearranges the array such that all elements before the pivot are smaller and all elements after are larger, demonstrating the fundamental divide-and-conquer strategy of quicksort.
