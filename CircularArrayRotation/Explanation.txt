Solves array rotation queries efficiently. Given an array rotated k times to the right, it answers queries asking for values at specific indices in the rotated array. Instead of actually rotating the array, it uses modular arithmetic: effectiveRotations = k % n handles full rotations, and originalIndex = (query - effectiveRotations + n) % n calculates where the queried element was in the original array.
