Performs left rotations on an array by calculating new positions for each element using modular arithmetic. Instead of actually shifting elements multiple times, it computes the final position for each element in a single pass. For each element at index i, its new position after d left rotations is determined by the formula (i + n - d) % n, where n is the array length. This efficient approach handles the rotation in linear time O(n) and works within the constraints of up to 1,000,000 elements
