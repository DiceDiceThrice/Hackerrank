Implements the insertion sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. The algorithm works by iterating through each element starting from the second position, treating the left portion as a sorted segment that gradually expands. For each current element, it compares it with elements in the sorted segment from right to left, shifting larger elements one position to the right until finding the correct insertion point. Unlike the previous version that displayed intermediate steps, this implementation performs the entire sorting process silently and only outputs the final fully sorted array once all elements have been properly positioned in their correct order.
