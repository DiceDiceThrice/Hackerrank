Determines if string s can be transformed into string t using exactly k operations (append or delete one character). It finds the common prefix length, calculates minimum operations needed (delete non-common part of s, append non-common part of t), then checks if k operations work: either exactly matches minimum operations, has extra even operations (can waste by delete/append pairs), or can delete entire s and rebuild t with moves to spare.
