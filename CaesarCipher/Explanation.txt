Implements the Caesar cipher encryption. Each letter is shifted k positions forward in the alphabet (wrapping around if needed). It uses modulo 26 to handle rotations greater than the alphabet size. For each character, if it's a letter, it determines the base ('a' or 'A'), calculates the new position with wrapping, and appends the encrypted character. Non-letter characters remain unchanged.
