Calculates the minimum cost to construct a string by appending individual characters, where each unique character has a fixed cost of one unit regardless of how many times it appears. The solution leverages the fact that once a character is purchased, it can be appended multiple times without additional cost. By simply counting the number of distinct characters in the input string using the Distinct method, the program efficiently determines the total construction cost. This count represents the minimum number of character purchases needed since duplicate characters require no additional payment once their initial cost has been incurred.
