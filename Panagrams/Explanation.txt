Checks if a given sentence is a pangram, meaning it contains every letter of the English alphabet at least once. The input string is converted to lowercase, and only the letters are kept. These letters are stored in a set to avoid duplicates. If the set contains exactly 26 letters, the program outputs "pangram", otherwise it outputs "not pangram". The result is written to an output file.
