Determines whether a given string can be rearranged to form a palindrome, inspired by the "Game of Thrones" theme. The solution analyzes character frequencies to identify if the string meets palindrome rearrangement conditions. It counts occurrences of each character in the string, then examines how many characters have odd frequencies. For even-length strings to be palindromic, no character can have an odd frequency count, ensuring perfect symmetry. For odd-length strings, exactly one character can have an odd frequency, allowing that single character to serve as the center of the palindrome. The program returns "YES" if these conditions are satisfied, otherwise "NO".
