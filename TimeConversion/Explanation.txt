Process:

Extract AM/PM from the end of the input string
Remove AM/PM to get just the time portion
Split the time by colons to separate hours, minutes, and seconds
Convert the hour based on these rules:

AM: If it's 12 AM (midnight), change hour to 0. Otherwise keep as-is
PM: If it's NOT 12 PM (noon), add 12 to the hour. 12 PM stays as 12


Format and return the result with 2-digit hour format
