Calculates the minimum characters needed to make a password strong. A strong password must: 1) be at least 6 characters long, and 2) contain at least one digit, one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one special character. It checks which criteria are missing, counts them, then returns the maximum of missing criteria or characters needed to reach length 6 (since adding characters can satisfy both requirements).
