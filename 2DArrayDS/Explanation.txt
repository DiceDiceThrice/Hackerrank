Calculates the maximum sum of all possible hourglass patterns in a 6x6 2D array. An hourglass pattern consists of 7 elements arranged in the shape of an hourglass: three consecutive elements in the top row, one element in the middle row, and three consecutive elements in the bottom row. The solution iterates through all valid starting positions (rows 0-3 and columns 0-3) where a complete hourglass can fit, calculates the sum of each hourglass's elements, and tracks the maximum sum encountered. The algorithm efficiently explores all 16 possible hourglass positions in the 6x6 grid to find the highest sum
