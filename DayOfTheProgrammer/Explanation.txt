Finds the 256th day of the year (Day of Programmer) in different calendar systems. It handles three cases: Julian calendar (before 1918, leap if divisible by 4), the transition year 1918 (when Russia switched calendars and skipped 13 days), and Gregorian calendar (after 1918, complex leap year rules). Depending on whether it's a leap year, the 256th day falls on either September 12th or 13th (or 26th in 1918).
