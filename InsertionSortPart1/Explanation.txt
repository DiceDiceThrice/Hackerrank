Demonstrates the final step of an insertion sort algorithm where a single element is positioned correctly within a nearly sorted array. The algorithm takes the last element of the array as the value to insert and works backward through the sorted portion, shifting elements one position to the right whenever they are greater than the target value. Each time elements are shifted, the current state of the array is printed. Once the correct position is found where the previous element is smaller or the beginning is reached, the target value is placed in its proper position, and the final sorted array is displayed, completing the insertion process.
