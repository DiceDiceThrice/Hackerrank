Sorts an array of numeric strings that may be too large for standard numeric data types by implementing a custom comparison logic. The solution uses a specialized comparer that first examines string lengths since shorter numeric strings inherently represent smaller numbers. When strings have equal lengths, it performs a character-by-character comparison from left to right, effectively comparing digits at each position until a difference is found. This approach efficiently handles very large numbers without conversion to numeric types, ensuring proper numerical ordering while treating the values as strings throughout the sorting process.
