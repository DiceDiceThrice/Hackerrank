Determines whether input strings are "funny" by comparing the absolute differences between consecutive characters in the original string with those in the reversed string. For each test case, it converts the input string to a character array and creates a reversed version. Then it iterates through both arrays simultaneously, calculating the absolute differences between adjacent characters at each position. If all corresponding differences match exactly between the original and reversed sequences, the string is classified as "Funny"; otherwise, it returns "Not Funny".
