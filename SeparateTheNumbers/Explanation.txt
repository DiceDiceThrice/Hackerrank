Determines if a given string can be split into a sequence of consecutive increasing numbers. It processes multiple test cases where for each input string, it checks all possible starting number lengths. For each potential starting number, it verifies there are no leading zeros unless the number is exactly zero, then constructs a sequence by repeatedly adding the next consecutive number. If the constructed sequence exactly matches the original string, it identifies the sequence as valid and outputs the starting number; otherwise, after checking all possibilities, it concludes the string cannot form such a sequence.
