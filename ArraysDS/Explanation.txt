Reverses the order of elements in an array by creating a new list and populating it with elements from the original array in reverse sequence. The solution reads the array size and elements from input, then iterates from the last index to the first, adding each element to a new list. This approach efficiently creates a reversed version of the input array without modifying the original data structure, ensuring the elements appear in exactly opposite order while maintaining their individual values
