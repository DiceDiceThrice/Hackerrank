Finds all pairs of numbers in an array that have the smallest absolute difference between them. The solution begins by sorting the array to efficiently examine consecutive elements. It then performs an initial pass through the sorted array to determine the minimum difference between adjacent elements. Once the smallest gap is identified, a second pass collects all pairs of consecutive numbers that exhibit this minimum difference. Each qualifying pair is added to the result list with both numbers included, creating a comprehensive output of all closest number pairs from the original array
