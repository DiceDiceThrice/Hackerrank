Calculates the minimum miles Marc must run to burn calories from eating cupcakes, where each cupcake's calorie count is multiplied by 2 raised to the power of its consumption order. The solution strategically sorts the calorie counts in descending order so the highest-calorie cupcakes are consumed first, minimizing the exponential multiplier's impact on larger values. The algorithm then computes the total miles by summing each cupcake's calories multiplied by 2 raised to its position index, using bit-shifting for efficient power-of-two calculation. This greedy approach ensures the optimal sequence that minimizes the total running distance required
