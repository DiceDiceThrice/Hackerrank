Performs a simple linear search to find the index of a target value within a sorted array. The solution reads the target value and array size from input, then processes the array elements. It iterates through each element sequentially from the beginning, comparing each element with the target value. When a match is found, it immediately returns the current index position. Since the problem guarantees that the target value exists in the array, the function will always find a valid index, though it includes a return -1 statement as a safety measure. This straightforward approach efficiently locates the target value's position in the array.
