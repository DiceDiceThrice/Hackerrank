Calculates the minimum number of character deletions required to make two strings anagrams of each other. The solution works by counting the frequency of each character in both input strings using two integer arrays that track occurrences of each letter from 'a' to 'z'. After building complete frequency profiles for both strings, it compares the counts for each character and sums the absolute differences between their frequencies. This total represents the number of characters that need to be removed from either string to balance their character compositions, ensuring both strings end up with identical character counts and thus become anagrams of one another.
