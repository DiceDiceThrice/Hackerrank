Calculates the minimum number of deletions required to transform a string into one with no two adjacent characters that are the same. For each input string in a series of queries, it scans through the characters sequentially from left to right, comparing each character with its immediate neighbor. Whenever two consecutive characters are identical, it increments a deletion counter since one of these characters would need to be removed to achieve the alternating pattern. The total count of such adjacent duplicates represents the number of deletions needed, which is then output for each test case. The solution efficiently processes all queries and writes the results to a specified output file.
