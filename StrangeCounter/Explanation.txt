Calculates the value displayed by a strange counter at time t. The counter starts at 3 and counts down. When it reaches 1, it resets to double the previous starting value. The pattern is: cycle 1 starts at 3 (times 1-3), cycle 2 starts at 6 (times 4-9), cycle 3 starts at 12 (times 10-21), etc. It finds which cycle contains time t, then calculates the countdown value within that cycle.
