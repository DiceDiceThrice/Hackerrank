Calculates the minimum number of changes needed to make a binary string beautiful by ensuring it contains no occurrences of the substring "010". The solution scans through the binary string looking for this specific pattern. When it encounters "010", it counts this as one change requirement and then skips ahead by three positions to avoid overlapping patterns, since modifying one character can resolve multiple potential issues. If the pattern is not found, it simply moves to the next character. The total count of required modifications is returned and written to an output file, providing an efficient solution that processes the string in a single pass.
